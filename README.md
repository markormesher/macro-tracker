# Macro Tracker

A web-based tracker for food and exercise, supporting complex nutrition targets and integration with Nutritionix and supermarket APIs for food data.

Feel free to clone it and have a play - see [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for an example setup. You'll need to supply your own API keys and private NPM packages for Font Awesome. Note that this is an opinionated tool that I've built for personal use, not something I intend to formally "release" and support for anyone else.
