# Macro Tracker

A web-based tracker for food and exercise, supporting complex nutrition targets and integration with Nutritionix and supermarket APIs for food data.

Feel free to clone it and have a play - see [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for an example setup. Note that this is an opinionated tool that I've built for personal use, not something I intend to formally "release" and support for anyone else.
